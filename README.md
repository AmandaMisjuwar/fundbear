#fundbear

fundbear is a web app that aims to bridge the gap between serious donors and organizations to provide immediate relief to natural disasters.

We hope that we can ensure transparency and integrity between donors and organizations, increase engagement in helping others globally, and provide immediate relief in critical situations.
